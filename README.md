## Purpose: 
The purpose of this lab is to implement a Min 3-Heap priority queue and a Max 3-Heap priority queue.

## General Requirements: 
In this lab, you are required to implement an array-based implementation of Min 3-Heap and Max 3- Heap, with each of them being treated as a priority queue.  You are to read in the numbers from a data file of integers and insert each number into a Min 3-Heap (and Max 3-Heap).
